## General Information
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
- Background :- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
-Business Problem:- 
  Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
  How well those variables describe the price of a house.
  Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
-Dataset :-Please find the dataset in my github repository itself.
